# RemoteXboxController
This is a Python project that is designed to add functionality to use an Xbox controller to play games that use a controller on a remote machine.

To use this program, just open gamesend.py on the computer with the controller plugged in, and open gamerecv.py on the computer with the game running on it. Afterwords, just enter the IP of the computer running gamerecv.py into gamesend.py, and make sure the port you're using is forwarded on the gamerecv.py side, and you're good to go!
